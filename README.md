# Rilot

‚ö° Fast, lightweight, and pluggable reverse proxy with WebAssembly (WASM) overrides.
Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è in Rust for microservices, frontend multi-zone architectures, and blazing edge performance.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- üöÄ Hot-reload WebAssembly overrides (no restart needed)
- üõ°Ô∏è Minimal memory proxy with Hyper + Tokio
- üî• Per-path dynamic routing (`contain` / `exact` match)
- üîÑ Seamless header manipulation without backend code changes
- üìù Fully customizable with simple `config.json`
- ‚ö° Ultra-fast cold start and live updates
- üõ†Ô∏è Built-in Docker support(coming soon)
- üîí MIT Licensed (no liability, use at your own risk)

## üõ†Ô∏è How it Works

Rilot acts as a **frontdoor proxy**,
Routing based on URL paths,
Injecting WebAssembly (WASM) modules dynamically to modify behavior without server restart.

## üöÄ Quick Start Example

1. Create a folder `my_app/`

```plaintext
my_app/
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile (optional) -> if you want to deploy docker container
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ runtime/override_sample.wasm (optional) -> build wasm with (AssemblyScript / Rust / )
```

2. Example `config.json`:

```json
{
    "proxies": [
        {
            "app_name": "App 1",
            "app_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:5502",
            "override_file": "/path/to/override.wasm",
            "rule": {
                "path": "/",
                "type": "exact"
            }
        },
        {
            "app_name": "App 2",
            "app_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:5501/",
            "rule": {
                "path": "/app2",
                "type": "contain"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

3. Run Rilot:

```bash
cargo run ./my_app/config.json
```

‚úÖ Your proxy server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Explained

- `app_name`: Friendly name for your service
- `app_uri`: Target backend URL
- `override_file`: Optional WebAssembly module to override headers / routing
- `rule.path`: URL path to match
- `rule.type`: `"exact"` or `"contain"`

‚úÖ No complicated config ‚Äî simple and powerful.

## üî• Live Hot-Reload of Overrides

Every request dynamically loads the `.wasm` file!
‚úÖ No server restart needed
‚úÖ Modify your override logic live
‚úÖ Instant effect on next request
